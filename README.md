## Strategy

We broke our team into front-end and back-end. From there, we separated different tasks amongst each other to avoid merge conflicts.

### Built with

- CSS
- {{Handlebars}}
- JavaScript
- Passport
- MySQL
- ExpressJS

### Continued development

Our application is still in the beta stages. We intend to add a functional appointment calendar, clean up our code, and add a separate section for nurses to login
